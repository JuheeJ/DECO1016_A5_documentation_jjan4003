			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
			<p>Interviewed who have interest in design or create something and who are interested in charity or donations.</p>
			<ul><li><strong>High School Students</strong></li>
			<p><em><u>Experiences relate on charities:</u></em>
			<br/>Not at all, or went to orphanage or sanatorium to help in school. Also, I teached young children on arts in the small centre.
			<br/><em><u>Worries:</u></em>
			<br/>Can't find charities easily through website, can find but don't know whether it is reliable. Want to know how volunteering to involve the charities, but I don't have much information for it. 
			<br/><em><u>Needs:</u></em>
			<br/>They need to know more information on how to donate and how is it work. <br/>
			<em><u>Requires:</u></em>
			<br/>They requires can find information easily about the method on how the charities work and how can they help them.</p></ul>
			<blockquote>
				As a highschool students(not an adult), have no enough money and time to donate.
			</blockquote>
			<ul><li><strong>University Students</strong></li>
			<!-- Use the blockquote element if applicable -->
			<p><em><u>Experiences relate on charities:</u></em>
			<br/>Have been donate through school, such as collecting gold coin or make baby hats to send Africa. 
			<br/><em><u>Worries:</u></em>
			<br/>Can see many charities through SNS or advertisement during TV and Youtube, but they don't have much information about the charities are able to trust and how the donation work.
			<br/><em><u>Needs:</u></em>
			<br/>They needs more information on how donated money used and where they go.<br/>
			<em><u>Requires:</u></em>
			<br/>They requires photo or authentication that where our donation goes
			</p></ul>
				<blockquote>
				I am willing to donate, but if I donate, I wonder where my money is going and I can't believe it for few websites(charities).
			</blockquote>
      <p>Overall, High school and University students had difficulties to get deep infromation about charities and how to donate their money. Also, eventhough they want to donate, or volunteering, they were not sure about the site/the charity is trustable or not. Therefore, they want information that where the money goes and how the money spents. </p>

			<br/>
			<p>Second Sketches. I chosed 2 and 3 from PC website and mobile website. I tried to choose one, but the combining two designs will be better than chosing one. Therefore, I got the rough sketches of my web designs.</p>
