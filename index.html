			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
			<p>As I mentioned in <a href="Proposal.html">proposal,</a>the designs, it was pretty hard to make what I want and what I think.<br/>
      <br/><img src="Wireframe.jpg" width=400 alt="wireframe">
      <section id="Plans"> 
      <br/><strong>Plans:</strong> 
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic swipe of photo on homepage.</li> 
        <li>1/3 of hompage is filled with orange color.</li>
        <li>Navigation bars on the top of the page.</li>
        <li>Navigation bars are staying on the top eventhough the scroll is down.</li>
        <li>Events images and its categories are in hompage, and scrolled horizontally in each categories.</li>
      </ul>
      These two was main points that I looking for but I couldn't make it.

      <section id="Problems">
      <strong>Problems:</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic swipe of photo on homepage</li> 
        <li>1/3 of hompage needs filled with orange color</li>
        <li>Scale of images</li>
      </ul>
      <img src="107Homepage1.png" width=400 alt=homepage></br>
       Automatic swipe needs java script, so it wasn't able to express.<br/>
      And fill with orange color of 1/3 of homepage was weird to see through wide screen.<br/>
      Also, the scale of images were hard to manage when consider mobile phone size and computer size.
      </section>
      <section id="What is working now">
      <strong>What is working, and what is showing now:</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>The events part in homepage are scrolled vertically</li> 
        <li>Donation page, with space that can fill details that they donate</li>
        <li>Event pages, with details (where, when, how, what)</li>
        <li>Hover, when mouse cursor is on the nav, the black changes into white</li>
        <li>Footer with detail of the organisation, sns and way to the 107 organisation.</li>
        <li>Favicon</li>
        <img src="favicon.png" width=200 alt=homepage></br>
      </ul>
      <img src="107Homepage2.png" width=400 alt=homepage></br>

      <section id="designs">
        <strong>Designs</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Orange color symbolises creativity. Therefore, the main color will be Orange: <br/>color codes: #FFCC99 #FF9966 #FF6600 #FFFFFF
        </li> 
        <li>Used Orange striped to emphasises different sections</li>
        <li>As put images of events horizontally, to make easy to understand that they are in same categories</li>
      </ul>
      </section>
      <section id="The parts that needs development">
      <strong>The parts that needs development</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Automatic swipe of photo on homepage (need to learn more deep with java scripts)</li> 
        <li>scaling the page in mobile and computer more reasonable and clean.</li>
        <li>Scale of images that shows correctly and with no streched out either mobile and computer.</li>
        <li>When I tested it with my friends and family, they said it is easy to navigate to other pages but need more contents.</li>
      </ul>
